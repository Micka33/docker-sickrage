docker-sickrage
===============

Create a docker that contains [sickrage][1] ready to use.  


[Sickrage][1] will restart automatically when it crash or is shutted down through the web-interface.  


The web interface has no user/password pre-configured. You will have to do it on your first connection.  


Docker-sickrage is not bundled with rtorrent or any other torrent client. *FOR NOW*.  
A docker-rtorrent is coming soon, preconfigured to work with docker-sickrage.  

A bundle including sickrage/rtorrent, ready-to-use, is coming soon on Vagrant.
